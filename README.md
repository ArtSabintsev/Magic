# Magic
## An alternative for Swift's `print()` along the lines of `DLog`

### Background

If you're like me, you miss seeing the filename, method name, and/or line number in your `print` statements in your Swift projects.

Fear not, `Magic` is here to bring you back to the good old days of `DLog`.

This extension was previously known as **PrintlnMagic**.

### Changelog (v2.0.0)
- Updated to use Swift 2.0 syntax
- Updated for iOS 9
- Contains only one global method named `magic()`

### Installation
- **CocoaPods**
  - `pod 'Magic'`
  - Make sure to call `import Magic` in the files you want to use it.

### Usage

#### magic()
Replace all the `print()` statements in your project with `magic()`.

#### Example
Before `Magic`, your console will display the following from `print()`:

```swift

This is a test string.

```

After `Magic`, your console will display the following from `magic()`:

```swift
ViewController.viewDidLoad()[17]: This is a test string.

// Where:
//     ViewController is the filename
//     viewDidLoad() is the name of the function
//     [17] is the line number
```
