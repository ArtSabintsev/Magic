/**
    Writes the textual representation of `object` and a newline character into the standard output.
    The textual representation is obtained from the `object` using its protocol conformances,
    in the following order of preference: `Streamable`, `Printable`, `DebugPrintable`.

    This function also augments the original function with the filename, function name, and line number of the object that is being logged.

    - parameter object:   A textual representation of the object.
    - parameter file:     Defaults to the name of the file that called magic(). Do not override this default.
    - parameter function: Defaults to the name of the function within the file in which magic() was called. Do not override this default.
    - parameter line:     Defaults to the line number within the file in which magic() was called. Do not override this default.
